    <h1>COURSES OFFERED</h1>
    <div><h2>Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
        <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering came into being in 2006 as a result of renaming of the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology. The Department of Computer Science and the Department of Information Technology were merged in 2004 and renamed as Department of Computer Science and Information Technology.

The Department of Computer Science was started in July, 1994 under the school of Science and Technology. It was started with the object of promoting specialized knowledge in the field of Computer Science and Computer Application. In view of the world wide shortage of skilled manpower in the field of Information Technology, the Department strives to channelize talented youth of the region to this challenging and knowledge intensive field by imparting quality technical knowledge and skills in the field. The programmes started under this department were Master of Computer Application (MCA), Master of Science (by Research) in Computer Science and PhD in Computer Science. The programmes have been designed keeping in mind the needs of the global Information Technology Industry.</p>
        <h2>Electronics and Communication Engineering</h2>
        <p>Established in 1997, the department offers M.Tech. in two specializations (Electronics Design and Technology, Bioelectronics) and B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering. The department offers Ph.D. in major areas.
        </p>
        <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
        <p>TThe Department of Civil Engineering of Tezpur University was established in the year 2009 under the School of Engineering with a B. Tech. programme. Ph.D. Programme was initiated in winter, 2010 and the M. Tech. programme of the department was started from Autumn, 2018. The Department aims to provide quality education, research and professional experiences that enable its graduates to become leaders in their professional careers, to pursue excellence in research and to serve the profession, community and nation, and to be competitive in the international scene</p>
    
    <h2>Electrical Engineering</h2>
        <p>The Electrical Engineering department started in 2014 under the School of Engineering with the B.Tech program. The prime motive of the department is to impart quality education, training and research at the undergraduate level in forefront areas of Electrical Engineering and its allied technologies. The Department currently offers B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering. This programme aims at producing engineers with sound basic and applied knowledge in electrical engineering.

            Department plans to expand its teaching and research infrastructure, enhance its industrial and research collaboration, and implement modern techniques for training to realize the above goal.
            
            The key areas of faculty expertise of the department include Power System Engineering, Power Electronics, Nonlinear Analysis-Theory, Methods & Applications, Control Systems, Fractional Order Chaotic Systems, Converter and Inverter Topologies, Sensor Technologies, Smart Grid Technologies and Policy Design, Distributed Generation Based System Optimization, Renewable Energy Management, Bio-electronics and Neuro Engineering.
            </p>
            <h2>Mechanical Engineering
            </h2>
            <p> The department of Mechanical Engineering was started in the year 2006 under the School of Engineering for offering a B.Tech degree with an annual intake of 60 students. Gradually, the department has expanded to offer M.Tech and PhD in various fields of Mechanical Engineering. Both, B.Tech and M.Tech programmes are AICTE approved. Also, the B.Tech programme is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) with effect from January 01, 2016. The Department of Mechanical Engineering has the principal objective to cater to the latest need for technical manpower in infrastructural sectors of the country.</p>
